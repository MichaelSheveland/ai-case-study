## Recommendations

* Advise to Airbnb: I beleive Airbnb has done a great job using technology however I believe that they could do better by increasing its AI capabilities. Such as being able to reasonably being able give advice for issues found or provide partial  refunds for the cost incurred such as the house smells and air freshners are needed or door lock is not closing. As well any other maintance issues that would typically need a host to respond to could be resolved with the guest at that current time. 

* Benefits to Airbnb:  I beleive this could increase the customer satisfaction so that guest do not need wait for a response from a host. This would help address the known weakness of the company and that is standardization in which issues can adrise from.  

* Technologies to Utilize: Utilizing AI that could automate customer serivce items. Then from there expanding its ability within AI throughout the company such as data metrics and reporting to host so that they can be best prepared for guest. 

* Suitable Solution: Bringing together more technolgy and implementing AI further into what Airbnb does can help customer satisfaction to both the guest and consumer providing the ability for increased revenue and setting Airbnb further ahead from its consumer. This is a suitable solution as Airbnb advances they can change the way AI interacts with the consumer as the environment changes such as challanges seen duirng Covid.
