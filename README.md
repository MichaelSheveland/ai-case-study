* Performance Relative to Competitors: Airbnb's strengths are their global presence and brand recognition along with diverse accomodation options. However, there are weaknesses which include regulatory challenges such as those implemented by many cities and countries to address concerns about housing affordability and the impact on local communities. Another challenge is that Airbnb is dependent on its hosts compared to the competitors, such as chain hotels, meaning that there is less consistent quality and standardization. Economic downturn has caused a decrease in revenue and profitability making the company vulnerable to economic fluctuations. ([Performance Analaysis](https://pitchgrade.com/companies/airbnb))

## Recommendations

* Advice to Airbnb: I beleive Airbnb has done a great job using technology however I believe that they could do better by increasing its AI capabilities. Such as being able to reasonably give real time advice for rental issues or provide partial refunds for costs incurred during the stay such as the house smells and air freshners are needed or door lock is not closing. This technology could also respond to other maintenance issues that could be resolved real time vs. typically needing a host to respond to a complaint. 

* Benefits to Airbnb:  I beleive this could increase the customer satisfaction so that guest do not need to wait for a response from a host. This would help address the known weakness of the company, that is standardization in which issues can arise from.  

* Technologies to Utilize: Utilizing AI that could automate customer serivce items. Then from there expanding its ability within AI throughout the company such as data metrics and reporting to host so that they can be best prepared for guest. 

* Suitable Solution: Bringing together more technolgy and implementing AI further into what Airbnb does can help customer satisfaction to both the host and guests, providing the ability for increased revenue and setting Airbnb further ahead from its competitor. This is a suitable solution as Airbnb advances they can change the way AI interacts with the consumer as the environment changes such as challanges seen duirng Covid.
